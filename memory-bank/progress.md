# Progress Log — Rapid-Test Chatbot UI

Date: 2025-08-06
Phase: Architecture → Implementation Prep (Integration Validation)

Summary
- Executed Gradio 5.x UI contract tests and documented outcomes in [integration-report.md](integration-report.md).
- Identified mismatch between DummyGradio constructor names and real Gradio 5.41.0 for Dropdown causing cascading test failures.
- Architecture decision recorded: introduce UI Compatibility Adapter boundary to reconcile constructor variance without changing production behavior.

Completed
- Environment prepared per [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) with Gradio 5.41.0
- Targeted execution of [tests/test_ui_contract_gradio5.py](tests/test_ui_contract_gradio5.py)
- Minimal UI guards in [app/ui.py](app/ui.py:1) (Markdown hasattr guard; removed Row wrapper; constructor resolver exploration)
- Integration report produced with RCA and recommendations: [integration-report.md](integration-report.md)
- Decision logged: “UI Compatibility Adapter for Gradio 5.x and DummyGradio” in [memory-bank/decisionLog.md](memory-bank/decisionLog.md)

In Progress
- Documenting UI Factory Adapter Pattern in [memory-bank/systemPatterns.md](memory-bank/systemPatterns.md:1)
- Coordinating implementation plan across roles (Architect, Code Implementer, TDD, Security Reviewer, Integrator)

Next Actions (Approved)
1) Create adapter module [app/gr_compat.py](app/gr_compat.py) exporting factories: dropdown, textbox, button, chatbot, markdown, state
2) Refactor [app/ui.py](app/ui.py:1) to consume adapter factories (no behavior or security changes)
3) Add unit tests for adapter mapping under real Gradio and DummyGradio-like surface
4) Re-run [tests/test_ui_contract_gradio5.py](tests/test_ui_contract_gradio5.py) and full test suite
5) Security review to confirm adapter introduces no new risk

Quality Gates
- Specification: passed (scope and acceptance constraints captured)
- Architecture: passed (adapter boundary pattern selected and documented)
- Refinement & Completion: pending implementation and test rerun

Security Invariants
- No API keys logged or rendered
- Errors remain sanitized; production streaming and event wiring unchanged

Risks and Mitigations
- Unknown DummyGradio constructor names beyond probe set → enable deterministic probing order and allow mapping injection in tests
- Future Gradio surface drift → adapter boundary centralizes future updates

Ownership and Delegation
- sparc-architect: finalize adapter API; update patterns and decision log (done)
- sparc-code-implementer: implement [app/gr_compat.py](app/gr_compat.py) and refactor [app/ui.py](app/ui.py:1)
- sparc-tdd-engineer: adapter unit tests; ensure contract tests pass in both environments
- sparc-security-reviewer: validate no new risks; confirm sanitization unchanged
- sparc-integrator: re-run contract tests and full suite; update progress

Review Schedule
- Adapter implementation check-in: 2025-08-07
- Post-test rerun review and pattern finalization: 2025-08-13

## Current Phase Summary
Phase: Refinement → Security Review → Completion (in transition)
Scope: Security remediations, dependency updates, container hardening, runtime validation, and deployment readiness.

Highlights:
- Dependencies remediated in source.
- Container hardened (ENV and HEALTHCHECK).
- Safety scan shows no issues for requirements.txt.
- Local execution tests skipped; need runtime validation and CI build.

## Milestone Timeline
- 2025-08-06: Implement dependency and container security remediations
  - gradio pinned to >=5.31.0,<6.0.0 (addresses SSRF/XSS/DoS items noted by Safety).
  - requests pinned to 2.32.4 (fixes CVE-2024-47081 .netrc leakage).
  - Dockerfile: added PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR=1, PYTHONHASHSEED=random, PYTHONUTF8=1; added HEALTHCHECK; retained non-root and slim base.
- 2025-08-06: Safety re-scan results:
  - requirements.txt: No issues found.
  - Account-level: 3 vulnerabilities ignored by policy; not applicable to this project file.

## Latest Updates
Artifacts changed:
- Dependencies: [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)
- Container: [Dockerfile](Dockerfile)

Validation performed:
- pip install + pytest attempted on Windows PowerShell; pip failed to fully install gradio 5.41.0 due to local disk OSError: [Errno 28].
- pytest executed; 26 skipped tests, indicating collection succeeded but no enabled functional tests cover Gradio 5.x paths.
- Safety scan after CLI registration: no issues for this requirements file.

Notes:
- Disk space limitation is local only; CI/Docker builds should proceed with adequate space.
- Gradio 5.x may introduce breaking changes; UI and wiring should be validated and minimally adjusted if needed.

## Open Actions and Delegations
1) TDD Engineer
   - Unskip/add tests for Gradio 5.x UI wiring and validators.
   - Cover sanitize_error_for_user and network timeout paths.
   - Targets: [tests/test_validators.py](tests/test_validators.py), [tests/test_state.py](tests/test_state.py), [tests/test_openrouter_client.py](tests/test_openrouter_client.py), plus new minimal UI contract tests referencing [app/ui.py](app/ui.py) and [main.py](main.py).

2) Code Implementer
   - Adjust [app/ui.py](app/ui.py) and [main.py](main.py) only if tests indicate Gradio 5.x API incompatibilities.
   - Maintain modularity and no secret handling in code.

3) Security Reviewer
   - Validate SSRF/XSS/DoS protections post-upgrade.
   - Review [app/validators.py](app/validators.py:36-81) sanitize_error_for_user and [app/openrouter_client.py](app/openrouter_client.py) network behavior.

4) DevOps Engineer
   - CI docker build and test execution with sufficient disk.
   - Reverse proxy hardening: block IMDS/metadata and RFC1918/RFC4193 ranges, normalize Host/Forwarded headers, apply rate limiting on POST / and WebSocket/stream endpoints.
   - Ensure HEALTHCHECK integration and observability.

5) Integrator
   - Execute E2E inside container:
     - docker build -t app:secure .
     - docker run -p 7860:7860 app:secure
     - Verify: API key entry (never rendered/logged), streaming works, allowlist model switching, invalid key sanitized error, simulated network timeout returns safe error.
     - Re-run Safety: python -m safety scan -r requirements.txt (expect no issues for this file).
