Conduct comprehensive security audit of current codebase:

Phase 1 - Architecture Review:
1. Switch to `sparc-security-architect` mode
2. Review current architecture for security vulnerabilities
3. Update threat model documentation
4. Identify security architecture gaps

Phase 2 - Code Audit:
1. Switch to `sparc-security-reviewer` mode  
2. Perform static analysis security testing
3. Review authentication and authorization mechanisms
4. Check for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
5. Validate input sanitization and output encoding

Phase 3 - Compliance Check:
1. Verify no hardcoded secrets or credentials
2. Check security logging and monitoring
3. Validate encryption and secure communications
4. Review access controls and permissions

Create comprehensive security-audit-report.md with:
- Vulnerability findings with severity ratings
- Specific remediation recommendations
- Security control validation results
- Compliance framework assessment
