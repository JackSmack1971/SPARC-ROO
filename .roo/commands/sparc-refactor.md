Execute systematic refactoring using SPARC principles for: $ARGUMENTS

1. Switch to `sparc-debug-specialist` mode first:
   - Analyze current code structure and identify issues
   - Document technical debt and complexity problems
   - Create refactoring-analysis.md with findings

2. Switch to `sparc-architect` mode:
   - Review current architecture against SPARC principles
   - Design improved modular architecture
   - Ensure 500-line file limit compliance
   - Update architecture.md and memory-bank/systemPatterns.md

3. Switch to `sparc-tdd-engineer` mode:
   - Create comprehensive test suite for existing functionality
   - Ensure all refactoring is covered by tests
   - Plan test strategy for new modular structure

4. Switch to `sparc-code-implementer` mode:
   - Implement refactored code following new architecture
   - Ensure strict adherence to SPARC principles
   - Maintain test coverage throughout refactoring

5. Switch to `sparc-security-reviewer` mode:
   - Validate refactored code maintains security standards
   - Ensure no security regressions introduced

Quality Gates:
- All tests pass before and after refactoring
- Files remain under 500 lines
- No hardcoded secrets introduced
- Security standards maintained
- Documentation updated to reflect changes
