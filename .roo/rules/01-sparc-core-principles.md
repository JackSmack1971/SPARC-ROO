### Universal SPARC Principles

These principles apply to all modes and all phases of development:

#### The Four Pillars:
1. **Modular Excellence**: Every component under 500 lines, with clear responsibilities
2. **Security Foundation**: No secrets in code, security by design always
3. **Test-Driven Quality**: Comprehensive testing enabling confident evolution
4. **Documentation Clarity**: Clear, maintainable documentation for all stakeholders

#### Memory Bank Integration:
All modes must maintain and reference the Memory Bank:
- `productContext.md`: Project vision and high-level understanding
- `decisionLog.md`: Architectural and technical decisions with rationale
- `systemPatterns.md`: Coding standards, patterns, and established practices
- `progress.md`: Task completion, milestones, and project status

#### Quality Over Speed:
Never skip SPARC phases. Each phase builds essential foundation for the next. Quality gates are not bureaucracy - they're enablers of sustainable development velocity.

#### Contextual Intelligence:
Use the full context of project history, architectural decisions, and established patterns to make informed decisions. Every choice should consider its impact on the entire system.

#### Collaborative Excellence:
Each mode has specialized expertise, but all work toward shared success. Communicate findings, share insights, and build on each other's work.
