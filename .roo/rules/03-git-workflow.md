# Git Workflow Practices
## Version Control Excellence for SPARC Development

### SPARC-Aligned Git Philosophy

Version control in SPARC development serves multiple purposes beyond simple code storage:
- **Traceability**: Every commit traces back to a specific SPARC phase and requirement
- **Quality Gates**: Git workflows enforce SPARC quality standards before code integration
- **Collaboration**: Multiple modes and developers can work simultaneously without conflicts
- **Memory Bank Integration**: Commits preserve context and decision rationale
- **Security**: Sensitive information never enters version control through proper practices

### Branch Strategy and Structure

#### GitFlow Adapted for SPARC Methodology

```
main (production-ready code only)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ develop (integration branch for completed SPARC cycles)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/sparc-auth-system (complete SPARC cycle for authentication)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/sparc-user-management (complete SPARC cycle for user features)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/sparc-api-gateway (complete SPARC cycle for API layer)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hotfix/security-patch-auth (emergency fixes)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ release/v1.2.0 (release preparation and testing)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ support/v1.1.x (long-term support branches)
```

#### Branch Naming Conventions

**Feature Branches** (Complete SPARC Cycles):
```bash
# Pattern: feature/sparc-{domain}-{feature-name}
feature/sparc-auth-user-login
feature/sparc-payment-subscription-management
feature/sparc-analytics-user-behavior-tracking
feature/sparc-api-rate-limiting

# For individual SPARC phases (when working in isolation):
feature/sparc-auth-specification
feature/sparc-auth-architecture
feature/sparc-auth-implementation
```

**Hotfix Branches** (Urgent Production Fixes):
```bash
# Pattern: hotfix/{severity}-{brief-description}
hotfix/critical-auth-bypass
hotfix/security-input-validation
hotfix/performance-database-timeout
```

**Release Branches** (Release Preparation):
```bash
# Pattern: release/v{major}.{minor}.{patch}
release/v1.0.0
release/v1.1.0
release/v2.0.0-beta
```

### Commit Message Standards

#### SPARC-Enhanced Conventional Commits

Every commit message must clearly indicate:
1. **SPARC Phase**: Which phase this commit represents
2. **Component**: What part of the system is affected
3. **Intent**: What change is being made and why
4. **Impact**: How this relates to requirements and quality gates

#### Commit Message Format
```

SPARC-Context:
- Phase: [Specification|Pseudocode|Architecture|Refinement|Completion]
- Quality Gate: [Passed|In Progress|Failed]

### Memory Bank Integration with Git

#### Automatic Memory Bank Updates

**Git Integration Script (.git/hooks/post-commit):**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Automatically update Memory Bank based on commit content

commit_message=$(git log -1 --pretty=%B)
commit_hash=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
commit_date=$(git log -1 --pretty=%cd --date=iso)

# Extract SPARC context from commit message
sparc_phase=$(echo "$commit_message" | grep -o "Phase: [^-]*" | cut -d' ' -f2)
requirements=$(echo "$commit_message" | grep -o "Requirements: [^-]*" | cut -d' ' -f2-)

# Update progress.md with commit information
if [ ! -z "$sparc_phase" ]; then
    echo "## Commit $commit_hash - $commit_date" >> memory-bank/progress.md
    echo "**Phase:** $sparc_phase" >> memory-bank/progress.md
    echo "**Requirements:** $requirements" >> memory-bank/progress.md
    echo "**Message:** $(echo "$commit_message" | head -1)" >> memory-bank/progress.md
    echo "" >> memory-bank/progress.md
fi

# Auto-commit Memory Bank updates (if changes detected)
if [ -n "$(git status --porcelain memory-bank/)" ]; then
    git add memory-bank/
    git commit -m "auto: update Memory Bank from commit $commit_hash"
fi
```

This Git workflow ensures that every aspect of SPARC development maintains traceability, quality, and collaborative excellence while preserving the project's architectural integrity and security standards.
